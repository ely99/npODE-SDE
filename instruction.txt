The file has been build with docker container. so first thing i did when i want to install new packages is to add to the docker file
The commando to build is:
docker build -t python35-project .

To run the default file (my_demo.py) is:
docker run --rm python35-project

To run a specific file is:
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app python35-project python specific_file.py

To run a specific file and enable the display function (in order to see the plots) is:
xhost +local:docker
and then:
docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    -w /app \
    python35-project python my_demo_load.py
